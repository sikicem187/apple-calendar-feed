## How to edit this feed

1. **Clone the repository** (or pull latest changes):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sikicem187/apple-calendar-feed.git
   ```

2. **Edit the `calendar.ics` file**:
   - The file follows the iCalendar (RFC 5545) format.
   - Each event is a `VEVENT` block between `BEGIN:VEVENT` and `END:VEVENT`.
   - To remove an event: delete its entire `VEVENT` block.
   - To add an event: create a new `VEVENT` block with proper `UID`, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
   - To modify an event: edit the fields within its `VEVENT` block.

3. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add calendar.ics
   git commit -m "chore: Update calendar events"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Apple Calendar will sync** automatically on its next refresh (based on your subscription frequency).

**Note:** Make sure your GitHub token has the `repo` scope for write access. If push fails with "Permission denied", update your token:
```bash
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo
```
